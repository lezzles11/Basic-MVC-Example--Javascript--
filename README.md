# Basic MVC using Javascript :rocket:

## Purpose :dark_sunglasses:

The purpose of this repository is to have a basic template in utilizing the MVC model (all written in javascript). This follows Tania Rascia's [example](https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/).

### Analogies :open_book:

### User Stories :telescope:

1. Users will be able to look through the various examples and understand how to write a javascript fullstack application.
